# ICAN Internal Policies

This directory is for internal policies that guide how Iowa Cannabis Action Network (ICAN) operates as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization. These materials supplement the formal governing records in `../legal` and help ensure consistent, compliant practices across programs and teams.

Examples of documents that belong here:
- Personnel, volunteer, and code of conduct policies.
- Data privacy, communications, and brand usage guidelines.
- Risk management, safety, and crisis response procedures.

Keep policies current with board or leadership approvals, and include effective dates or version history where applicable.
