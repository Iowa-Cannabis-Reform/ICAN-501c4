# ICAN Board and Operations Procedures

This directory contains operational reference materials that support Iowa Cannabis Action Network (ICAN) governance and day-to-day administration as a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization.

Use this space for:
- Board and committee procedures, meeting templates, and minute-keeping checklists.
- Annual calendars, onboarding guides, and corporate binder inventories.
- Process documents that describe how ICAN manages records, filings, and recurring compliance tasks.

Keep drafts clearly labeled and retain final versions so board members and staff can follow consistent, transparent procedures.
