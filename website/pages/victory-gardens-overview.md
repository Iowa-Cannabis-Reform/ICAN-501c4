# Victory Gardens – A Community Movement Rooted in Iowa

Welcome to **Victory Gardens**, a statewide program from the Iowa Cannabis Action Network (ICAN) that brings people together through gardening, community engagement, and local food sharing.

We believe that when Iowans grow food, share harvests, and learn from the land, we build stronger, healthier, more connected communities.

- Helps Iowans grow gardens of all sizes  
- Encourages regenerative growing practices  
- Supports local food banks with fresh produce

Whether you garden in a backyard, balcony, farm, or windowsill — **you belong here**.
