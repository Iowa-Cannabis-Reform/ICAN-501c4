# Projects – ICAN

This folder contains **active and developing initiatives** within ICAN before they are fully deployed or moved into permanent directories.

## Purpose
To organize:
- Pilot programs  
- Draft campaigns  
- Community outreach plans  
- Legislative or policy research  
- Website rebuild projects  
- Internal development initiatives  

## Structure
Each project should have its own subfolder including:
- `README.md` – purpose & owners  
- `notes.md` – working drafts  
- Supporting documentation  

## Notes
Once a project is operational, move it to `operations/` or `communications/` as appropriate.
